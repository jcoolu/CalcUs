# CalcUs
"Swiss Army" calculator app (Android only) (Not Finished/Scrapped)
This project was an idea I had for my Writing For Professional Settings class. 
We had to come up with an idea for a product for our makeshift company. For mine I chose to develop an android app called the CalcUs. The CalcUs was a product designed by my "company" called Coolu Inc.

CalcUs was an idea I designed for my Writing For Professional Settings class that involves a calculator app. This app's goal is to help those who need help with their school, work or personal life. It was supposed to be a "customizable and easy to use calculator application that can be used on your phone, tablet or pc." However the end goal was I created an app solely just for android. 

### With CalcUs, you can...

- Solve math problems by taking a picture (not finished; was created as a "demo" to show the functionality)
- finance (not in final product)
- create/use formulas (again not in final product)
- graph functions and tables (not finished; was created as a "demo" to show the functionality)
- number conversions (yes; can convert binary, decimal, hexadecimal, and octal)

- graph stats and probability (yes; coin toss, generate random numbers, dice roll, spin the wheel)

The CalcUs was designed to be like an all-in-one calculator app so you would not need a graphing calculator.
